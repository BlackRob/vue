# vue
A separate repo to try out vue: will I like it more than React? We'll see.
## test-app 
Front-end for a quiz app. Written in vue.js, mostly just to try it out.
## test-server-backend
An express.js based server that retrieves the questions and answers that make up a quiz from a MariaDB SQL database, then returns them as JSON to **test-app**. Hosted on Heroku, to try that out.
